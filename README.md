To start a new SystemJS-based project use the seed project from chapter 2. To create a new Webpack-based project use the seed angular2-webpack-seed from chapter 10.

It'll help you in getting started while reading Chapter 2.

This repo has some extra code samples that we use during our trainings. They didn't didn't make it into the book, but we decided to post them here in the folders called extras. While most of the book code samples are SystemJS-based apps, we started creating their Angular-CLI versions. For example, in chapter3/extras you'll find router samples in one CLI project. To run a specific app, change the value of the main property in the angular-cli.json file to point at the appropriate main file.
